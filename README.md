A small python repo for experimenting with pygame

When running, you use the keyboard to indicate which column you want the marker dropped in.

The number is in the range of 1 to 7, inclusive. If a column is full, the column header will disappear
to indicate that it will not accept an attempt to drop another marker there.

The game starts with RED as the player. Currently, after you drop a marker, the game flips to 
the other player (e.g., YELLOW). You can see who is playing by a small colored disk in the upper left.

You can force which color plays next with the keys 'r' or 'y'.

There is no real game logic yet.

Much remains to be done yere.
